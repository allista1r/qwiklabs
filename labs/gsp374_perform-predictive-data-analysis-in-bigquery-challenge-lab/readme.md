# Perform Predictive Data Analysis in BigQuery: Challenge Lab

## Topics tested

- Upload files from Cloud Storage into BigQuery tables using the console
- Write and execute queries that join information from multiple tables
- Analyze soccer event data using various BigQuery features
- Write functions in BigQuery to help with calculations to be performed on soccer shot data
- Create and evaluate an expected goals model using BigQuery ML
- Apply an expected goals model to make a prediction from new data using BigQuery ML


## Challenge scenario

Use BigQuery to load the data from the Cloud Storage bucket, write and execute queries in BigQuery, analyze soccer event data. Then use BigQuery ML to train an expected goals model on the soccer event data and evaluate the impressiveness of World Cup goals.
